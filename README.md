# rse_prob_robotics
This is the companion repository for my articles discussing the implementation of various algorithms based on the Probabilistic Robotics book.

As my journey into learning the different algorithms discussed in the book continues, I will be writing articles sharing a lot of what I have learned and implementing the code. My goal is not to obtain a general idea of how the algorithsm work and implement them with toy problems. I aim to gain deep understanding of the workings of the methods, and implement them in real-world scenarios using my full-size mobile robot (SEDRAD), a widely used (acamedia and industry) framework like ROS 2, mostly Python for quick implementations, and less often C++ when I feel the need for something more production ready. 

The different chapters/topics in the book will be roughly organized into ROS 2 packages. Some packages, like the one for Gaussian Filters, will have executable code that you will be able to run and test from your terminal. Others, like the packages for Robot Motion and Robot Perception, which contain algorithms used within most other chapters/topics, will provide more like support-code but may not have directly executable code.

This repository will be undergoing a lot of changes. The newly added code will be a bit messy at first as I aim at quick implementation, but then it will be refactored to be of better quality.
