# Introduction
This is the companion repository for my articles discussing the implementation of various algorithms based on the Probabilistic Robotics book.

As my journey into learning the different algorithms discussed in the book continues, I will be writing articles sharing what I have learned and implementing the code. My goal is not just to obtain a general idea of how the algorithms work and implement them with toy problems. I aim to gain a deep understanding of the methods and implement them in real-world scenarios using my full-size mobile robot (SEDRAD), a widely used framework like ROS 2, mostly Python for quick implementations, and occasionally C++ for more production-ready solutions.

The different chapters/topics in the book will be roughly organized into ROS 2 packages. Some packages, like the one for Gaussian Filters, will have executable code that you can run and test from your terminal. Others, like the packages for Robot Motion and Robot Perception, which contain algorithms used within most other chapters/topics, will provide support code but may not have directly executable code.

This repository will undergo many changes. Newly added code will be a bit messy at first as I aim for quick implementation, but it will be refactored for better quality over time.

If you encounter any problems with the code, please open an Issue, and I will try to fix it ASAP. For questions specific to a given implementation, please leave a comment on the related article. For general questions or to simply connect, please use any of the contact information below.

# Gaussian Filters
Implemented within the package [rse_gaussian_filters](rse_gaussian_filters), this series of articles covers mainly chapters 1 through 3 of the book and introduces the Kalman family of filters as well as the Information Filter.
